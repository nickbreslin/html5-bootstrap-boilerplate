This is a basic boilerplate which uses Bootstrap 5 as it's UI framework. Bootstrap 5 removes the previous dependency on jQuery, which allows for an easier understanding of basic JavaScript when it comes to making small interactive applications.

We will be using ES6 as our JavaScript coding standard. For more information you can check out:
